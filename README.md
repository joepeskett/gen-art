# Generative Art

A rough go at some basic generative art using the R programming language. To make this more interesting, if we can find some uses for using Rcpp, then that's an added bonus!

**Eventual goal:** can we use protein sequences/structures as inputs for generative art? Perhaps relationships between different sequences could be used?
